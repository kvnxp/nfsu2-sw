## ✨ Features

- 🏁 **Native code**: the whole game runs as recompiled C, built with
  [xboxrecomp](https://github.com/sp00nznet/xboxrecomp)
- 🎮 **Two renderers**: Vulkan (NVK on Switch, MoltenVK on macOS) and OpenGL,
  with render scaling up to 4x
- 📺 **Widescreen 16:9** by default, using the game's own wide mode
- 🎬 **Full-screen movies** decoded with FFmpeg (VP6)
- 🔊 **Audio** through an emulated Xbox APU, with 5.1 downmixed to stereo
- 👥 **Two-player split screen**, with Joy-Con pairs or one sideways Joy-Con
  per player
- 📳 **Rumble** on Switch HD rumble and SDL controllers
- 🔤 **Switch wording** in the menus (Start → `+`, no Xbox Live or hard-disk
  names)
- ⌨️ **Keyboard as a pad** on macOS and Linux when no controller is connected
  (on by default; **F1** opens the settings menu: remap, render scale
  x1/x2/x3, vsync, volume)
- 💾 Saves stay next to the game in `game/UDATA`

## 🕹️ Playing on Switch

1. Copy the NRO to `sdmc:/switch/nfsu2x/` (`nfsu2x-vulkan.nro` for the Vulkan
   build).
2. Copy the **extracted** disc (not the ISO) to `sdmc:/switch/nfsu2x/game/`.
3. Start it with **title takeover**: hold **R** while launching any game.
   Applet mode leaves too little memory.

```
sdmc:/switch/nfsu2x/
├── nfsu2x-vulkan.nro
├── nfsu2x_env.txt      optional settings, KEY=VALUE per line
└── game/
    ├── default.xbe
    └── ...
```

Buttons map by label (Switch A = Xbox A). Settings go in `nfsu2x_env.txt`
(see [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration)) and the log is written to the
same folder.

## 🕹️ Playing on macOS

```sh
platform/macos/build.sh /path/to/game     # builds and starts
```

That is the whole thing: it builds `build/nfsu2_recomp` and starts it with
`NFSU2_GAME_DIR` pointing at your disc. Without arguments it only builds, and
the binary then finds the disc by itself, in this order:

1. `NFSU2_GAME_DIR=...`
2. a `game/` directory next to the executable, holding `default.xbe`,
   `NFSUNDER/` and `B3/` — no environment needed at all
3. `./game` in the working directory

The window is created on the process' main thread and closes with its **X**.
Without a controller the **keyboard is player 1** (on by default;
`RECOMP_KEYBOARD=0` turns it off, and it merges with a real pad when there is
one):

| Key | Xbox |
|---|---|
| arrows | d-pad |
| Enter | START |
| Backspace | BACK |
| Z X A S | A B X Y |
| Q E | White / Black |
| 1 3 | L / R triggers |
| numpad 8 2 4 6 (or the number row) | left stick |
| I K J L | right stick |
| Shift / Ctrl | left / right stick button |

**F1** opens the settings menu over the game: **GRAPHICS** (render scale
x1/x2/x3 applied live, vsync), **KEYBOARD** (every action remappable with
Enter — twice for a stick axis — and a reset), **AUDIO** (volume 0..100).
Arrows move and adjust, Enter activates, Esc closes. Everything is kept in
`nfsu2.cfg` in the game directory, next to `UDATA` where the saves are
(`SCALE`, `VSYNC`, `VOLUME`, `KB_*`), so it survives restarts; the
environment still wins over the file.
`RECOMP_KEY_TRACE=1` logs every key as it arrives — the useful first check
when a key seems dead: the window has to have the focus.

## 🛠️ Building

<details open>
<summary><b>1. Lift the XBE to C</b></summary>

```sh
# Writes NFSU2_GEN_DIR (default /root/nfsu2x/gen)
NFSU2_XBE=/path/to/game/default.xbe NFSU2_GEN_DIR=/path/to/gen tools/regen.sh
```

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>2a. Linux</b> (SDL2, Vulkan or OpenGL)</summary>

```sh
platform/linux/build.sh /path/to/game     # builds and starts
platform/linux/build.sh                   # builds only, then prints how to run
# BUILD_DIR, JOBS, VULKAN=0, FFMPEG_DIR
```

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>2b. macOS</b> (Apple Silicon or Intel, Vulkan on MoltenVK)</summary>

Needs:

* Xcode Command Line Tools — `xcode-select --install`
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), then:

  ```sh
  brew install cmake pkg-config molten-vk vulkan-loader sdl2 libepoxy \
               openssl@3 glslang spirv-tools
  ```

  `libepoxy` and `pkg-config` are required even in the Vulkan build (the
  D3D8 shim links epoxy), and glslang/spirv-tools compile the shaders the
  title's vertex and fragment programs become. MoltenVK is the ICD that
  actually draws; vulkan-loader is what the app and SDL load.
* the lifted C of step 1 — `xboxrecomp/gen` by default, or `NFSU2_GEN_DIR`
* optional, for the movies instead of the slow lifted VP6 decoder:
  `tools/build_ffmpeg_vp6.sh mac`, then `FFMPEG_DIR`

```sh
platform/macos/build.sh /path/to/game     # builds and starts
platform/macos/build.sh                   # builds only, then prints how to run
# BUILD_DIR, JOBS, NFSU2_GEN_DIR, VULKAN=0, FFMPEG_DIR
```

Without arguments the binary finds the disc on its own: `$NFSU2_GAME_DIR`,
else a `game/` directory (`default.xbe`, `NFSUNDER/`, `B3/`) next to the
executable, else `./game` in the working directory.

The renderer is Vulkan on MoltenVK. `VULKAN=0` builds the GL renderer,
which has no window path on macOS yet: it leaves you with sound and no
picture.

### Project layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/main.c` | boot and runtime defaults |
| `src/recomp_manual.c` | hand-written overrides of lifted functions |
| `src/switch_nx.c` | Switch log device, env file, exception handler, loading screen |
| `config/seed_functions.json` | entry points the static pass cannot see |
| `xboxrecomp/` | the toolkit (MIT), vendored with this port's changes: NV2A renderers (Vulkan, OpenGL), SDL audio, Switch platform layer, translator fixes |
| `tools/regen.sh` | XBE → lifted C (`gen/`, never committed) |
| `platform/` | Per-platform build scripts: `platform/linux/build.sh`, `platform/macos/build.sh`, `platform/switch/build.sh` |

## ⚙️ Configuration

On Linux and macOS these are ordinary environment variables. On the Switch they go in
`sdmc:/switch/nfsu2x/nfsu2x_env.txt`, one `KEY=VALUE` per line (`#` starts a
comment). Anything left out runs at its default, which is the fastest normal
configuration. Most of the list is for debugging, so the sections below are folded.

```ini
# sdmc:/switch/nfsu2x/nfsu2x_env.txt
RECOMP_GL_SCALE=1.5
RECOMP_WIDESCREEN=0
```

<details>
<summary><b>Build and code generation</b></summary>

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `XBOXRECOMP_DIR` | Toolkit to build or regenerate with (default: the vendored `xboxrecomp/`). |
| `NFSU2_XBE` | `default.xbe` to lift (`tools/regen.sh`). |
| `NFSU2_GEN_DIR` | Directory for the lifted C (`tools/regen.sh` writes `/root/nfsu2x/gen`; the platform scripts default to `<repo>/xboxrecomp/gen`). |
| `LIFT_ONLY=1` | `regen.sh`: skip disasm / function id / ABI analysis and only re-lift (enough after translator or `recomp_manual.c` changes; seed changes need the full run). |
| `RECOMP_LEAF_LOCALS=0` | Translator: keep MMX leaf-function registers in globals instead of C locals. |
| `RECOMP_REG_LOCALS=0` | Translator: keep eax..edi/esp in globals instead of C locals. |
| `RECOMP_X87_LOCALS=0` | Translator: keep the x87 stack top in its global instead of a local. |
| `NFSU2_GAME_SRC` | `platform/switch/build.sh`: extracted disc to stage (default `/root/nfsu2x/game`). |
| `SD_ROOT` | `platform/switch/build.sh`: staging SD-card root (default `<repo>/switch_sd`). |
| `BUILD_DIR` | All three `platform/*/build.sh`: build directory (Switch `/root/nfsu2x/build-switch`, `-vk` with `VULKAN=1`; macOS and Linux `<repo>/build`). |
| `JOBS` | All three `platform/*/build.sh`: parallel compile jobs (6 fits the Switch's `-O2` in RAM). |
| `VULKAN` | All three `platform/*/build.sh`: `1` (the default) builds the Vulkan renderer, `0` the GL one — `nfsu2x-vulkan.nro` on the Switch, and on macOS the GL renderer has no window path yet. |
| `NVK_SDK`, `GLSLANG_DIR` | `platform/switch/build.sh` with `VULKAN=1`: mesa-switch NVK install and Switch glslang. |
| `FFMPEG_DIR` | All three `platform/*/build.sh`: LGPL VP6-only FFmpeg for the movies (`tools/build_ffmpeg_vp6.sh`). |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Game and host</b></summary>

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NFSU2_GAME_DIR` | Where the extracted disc is at run time: this variable, else a `game/` directory next to the executable (`default.xbe`, `NFSUNDER/`, `B3/`), else `./game` in the working directory. The Switch is always `sdmc:/switch/nfsu2x/game/`. |
| `NFSU2_GL=0` | Use the executor's CPU renderer instead of the GPU renderer. |
| `NFSU2_APU=0` | With `RECOMP_AC97_READY=plain`: no emulated APU (no sound). |
| `NFSU2_SIM_STEPS` | Longest game-time step per frame, in 1/60 s (default 6 = 100 ms; 3 = the original 50 ms cap, which slows races below 20 fps). |
| `NFSU2_NATIVE_VP6` | Movie decoder: 1 = FFmpeg (default when built with it), 0 = the lifted decoder, 2 = both and compare. |
| `NFSU2_MOVIE_FLASH=1` | Keep the opening trailer's white flash frames (shown black by default). |
| `NFSU2_SWITCH_TEXT` | Switch wording in the menus (Start → +, no Xbox Live/hard-disk names): 1 on (Switch default), 0 off. |
| `NFSU2_EXIT_TRACE=1` | Print the guest state at exit. |
| `RECOMP_WIDESCREEN=0` | Tell the game the TV is 4:3 (default 16:9). |
| `RECOMP_CMDLINE` | Command line handed to the title (e.g. `+map intro`). |
| `HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME` | Linux: fallback save directory (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/xboxrecomp`, else `~/.local/share/xboxrecomp`) when none is configured. NFSU2's own saves go to `<game>/UDATA`. |

| `NFSU2_LOADER=0` | No loading screen (logo + bar) before the first frame. |
| `RECOMP_NX_PROFILE` | Sampling profiler into `prof.bin`: 1 = busy threads, 2 = every thread above 2%. |
| `RECOMP_NX_SHM=1` | Guest RAM from shared memory instead of code memory. |
| `RECOMP_NX_AUDIO_PRIO=0` | Leave the APU and SDL audio threads at priority 59 (default: above the game threads). |

| `RECOMP_NX_JOYCON_ROTATE=0` | Don't rotate the sideways Joy-Con stick. |
| `RECOMP_GUEST_ONE_CORE` | 1 = pin guest threads to one core, 2 = guest threads only (interrupts float). |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Scheduling and kernel</b></summary>

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `RECOMP_GIL=0` | No guest lock (guest threads run in parallel; races the title's streaming). |
| `RECOMP_GIL_EAGER=1` | Hand the guest lock over by guest priority (main thread and time-critical threads pre-empt). |
| `RECOMP_KERNEL_FAST=0` | Release the guest lock in every kernel call, even the cheap time queries and IRQL changes. |
| `RECOMP_FRAME_LAG=1` | Wait on the previous frame's fence instead of the current one (game and GPU work overlap). |
| `RECOMP_VBLANK` | Vblank interrupt for D3D (default 1). |
| `RECOMP_WORKERS=inline` | Run the title's worker routines inline instead of on threads. |
| `RECOMP_ASYNC_IO=1` | Asynchronous NtReadFile. |

|---|---|
| 🐧 Linux | Boot, movies, profile, Main Menu, Quick Race and Career, with audio |
| 🍎 macOS (M1 Pro, MoltenVK) | Boot, movies, title screen, with a window, keyboard and F1; races not tested on macOS yet |
| 🎮 Switch hardware | Boot, movies, profile load/create, Main Menu, races |

Still open: cube maps on OpenGL (Vulkan has them: car reflections), bump/dot-product texture modes, fixed-function
lighting.
