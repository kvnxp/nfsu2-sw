"""Route a lifted function's memory accesses through MMIO-aware accessors.

A title's statically linked XDK libraries drive hardware registers directly --
DirectSound programs the APU at 0xFE800000 with ordinary `mov`s. The lifted
code turns those into MEM32(addr) like any other access, which only works
against a register block if the host traps the access (a page fault and an
instruction decoder, per host architecture). That exists on Windows/x86-64
alone.

For functions known to talk to hardware, this rewrites the generated C so
every access asks the runtime instead:

    MEM32(a)             -> MMIO_RD32(a)
    SMEM16(a)            -> ((int16_t)MMIO_RD16(a))
    MEM32(a) = v;        -> MMIO_WR32(a, (v));
    MEM32(a) |= v;       -> MMIO_WR32(a, MMIO_RD32(a) | (v));

MMIO_RDn/MMIO_WRn (recomp_types.h) take the plain-memory path unless the
address is in the device range, so the cost is one compare per access, paid
only in the functions selected -- the rest of the title is untouched.

The rewrite works on the C text: the lifter builds memory operands in many
places, and a textual pass over its output is the one point they all meet.
